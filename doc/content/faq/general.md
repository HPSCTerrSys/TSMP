# Contributing to TSMP in general

Contributions to TSMP are generally made through issues and pull requests.

If you find a bug, or have an idea for improving TSMP, please 
report it to the [TSMP issues](https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/TSMP/issues). 
[Members of HPSCTerrSys](https://github.com/orgs/HPSCTerrSys/people) will 
respond as soon as possible. To avoid unnecessary queries and missing 
information, please make use of one of the issue templates provided when you are 
opening a new issue.

Furthermore, if you already have a finished bugfix or other source-coded changes 
that you want to be part of TSMP, you need to create a PR. The PR thereby should 
always be linked to an open issue as a place for discussion. So first open an 
[issue](https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/TSMP/issues) describing your changes and 
why they are needed, then open a new [PR](https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/TSMP/pulls) 
linked to the previous issue. The 
[Members of HPSCTerrSys](https://github.com/orgs/HPSCTerrSys/people) will review 
your PR and decide whether to approve or reject it.
