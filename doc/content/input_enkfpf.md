## Control file `enkfpf.par` ##

An additional file named `enkfpf.par` needs to be present in the
TSMP-PDAF run directory.

`enkfpf.par` is read by the routine `read_enkfpar` in
`model/common/read_enkfpar.c`.

`enkfpf.par` contains information about the different model components
(ParFlow, CLM and data assimilation) like, e.g., the timing
information of the models, the prefixes for the ParFlow/ CLM input
files, etc.

This input is structured in four sections: 
- [`[PF]`](#pf) which holds information about ParFlow, 
- [`[CLM]`](#clm) which holds information about CLM 
- [`[COSMO]`](#cosmo) which holds information about COSMO
- [`[DA]`](#da) which holds information about the data assimilation process

An example for `enkfpf.par` is given below.  Note that the sequence of
the entries within these four categories can be changed if desired.

In the following the individual entries of `enkfpf.par` are described:

### [PF]

#### PF:problemname
`PF:problemname`: (string) Problem prefix for ParFlow.

#### PF:nprocs
`PF:nprocs`: (integer) Number of processors per ParFlow instance. Must
match with the specifications in the `*.pfidb` input.

This number of processors specifies a subset of the processors
available in a single `COMM_model`. Each `COMM_model` contains - if
there are no remainders - the following number of processes:
`npes_world / nreal`.

#### PF:starttime
`PF:starttime`: (real) ParFlow start time. Must match with the
specifications in the `*.pfidb` input (`TimingInfo.StartTime`).

#### PF:dt
`PF:dt`: (real) Length of ParFlow time step. Must match with the
specifications in the `*.pfidb` input. 

It is implicitly assumed that ParFlow and CLM calculate the same
amount of time steps (i.e., have the same time step
length). (Johannes: This may not be true, CLM time steps are computed)

#### PF:endtime (deprecated)

Deprecated. Use `PF:simtime` instead.

`PF:endtime`: (real) Total simulation time (in terms of ParFlow
timing). Must match with the specifications in the `*.pfidb` input.

#### PF:simtime
`PF:simtime`: (real) Total simulation time (in terms of ParFlow
timing). 

Must match with the specifications in the `*.pfidb` input.

`PF:simtime` must correspond to `TimingInfo.StopTime` MINUS
`TimingInfo.StartTime`!

#### PF:updateflag
`PF:updateflag`: (integer) Type of state vector update in ParFlow.

-   1: Assimilation of pressure data. State vector consists of
    pressure values and is directly updated with pressure
    observations.

-   2: Assimilation of soil moisture data. State vector consists of
    soil moisture content values and is updated with soil moisture
    observations. The updated soil moisture content is transformed
    back to pressure via the inverse van Genuchten functions.

-   3: Assimilation of soil moisture data. State vector consists of
    soil moisture content and pressure values. Soil moisture data are
    used to update pressure indirectly.

#### PF:gwmasking
`PF:gwmasking`: (integer) Groundwater masking for assimilation of
pressure data (updateflag=1) in ParFlow.

-   No groundwater masking.

-   Groundwater masking using saturated cells only.

-   Groundwater masking using mixed state vector.

#### PF:paramupdate
`PF:paramupdate`: (integer) Flag for parameter update

-   0: No parameter update

-   1: Update of saturated hydraulic conductivity

-   2: Update of Mannings coefficient

#### PF:aniso_perm_y
`PF:aniso_perm_y`: (real) Anisotropy factor of saturated hydraulic
conductivity in y-direction. Only used when hydraulic conductivity is
updated (`[PF]paramupdate = 1`). Important: Compare this anisotropy
factor with the corresponding anisotropy factor from
ParFlow-input. Currently, we believe that the ParFlow-factor is used
in the beginning of the simulation, while the factor set here, is used
after each parameter update.

#### PF:aniso_perm_z
`PF:aniso_perm_z`: (real) Anisotropy factor of saturated hydraulic
conductivity in z-direction. Only used when hydraulic conductivity is
updated (`[PF]paramupdate = 1`). Important: Compare this anisotropy
factor with the corresponding anisotropy factor from
ParFlow-input. Currently, we believe that the ParFlow-factor is used
in the beginning of the simulation, while the factor set here, is used
after each parameter update.

#### PF:printensemble
`PF:printensemble`: (integer) If set to `1`, the updated state
variables for all ensemble members is printed out as `pfb` files after
each assimilation cycle.  Files are printed to `[DA]outdir` and follow
the file naming convention of ParFlow. They include the specifier
`update` in the file name.

#### PF:printstat
`PF:printstat`: (integer) If set to `1` (default) the ensemble
statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the forecasted state
variable are calculated and printed out as `pfb` files after each
assimilation cycle. Files are printed to `DA:outdir` and follow the
file naming convention of ParFlow. The output files include the
specifiers `press.mean`/ `press.sd` in case of assimilated pressure
update `PF:updateflag = 1` and the specifiers `swc.mean`/ `swc.sd` in
case of assimilated soil moisture data `PF:updateflag = 2` or
`PF:updateflag = 3`.

#### PF:paramprintensemble
`PF:paramprintensemble`: (integer) Only used in case of parameter
update. If set to `1`, the updated parameters are printed to `pfb`
files (similar to `[PF]printensemble`). Output files include the
specifier `update.param`.

#### PF:paramprintstat
`PF:paramprintstat`: (integer) Only used in case of parameter
update. If set to `1` statistics on the updated parameters are printed
to `pfb` files (similar to `[PF]printstat`).

#### PF:olfmasking
`PF:olfmasking`: (integer) Only used in case you do not want to update
the state on certain grid-cells during DA with pdaf. eg. not update
the cell which is saturated. Option \"1\" means that all saturated
cells at surface are not used for an update. Option \"2\" reads a pfb
for masking the stream.

### [CLM]

#### CLM:problemname
`CLM:problemname`: (string) Problem prefix for CLM

#### CLM:nprocs
`CLM:nprocs`: (integer) Number of processors for each CLM instance.

This number of processors specifies a subset of the processors
available in a single `COMM_model`. Each `COMM_model` contains - if
there are no remainders - the following number of processes:
`npes_world / nreal`.

#### CLM:update_swc
`CLM:update_swc`: (integer) Flag for update of soil moisture content
in CLM (standalone only).

-  0: No update of soil moisture content

-  1: Update of soil moisture content

- (only branch `TSMP_pdaf-crns`) 2: Update and average of soil
  moisture content for use with Cosmic-Ray data (Hui Pung
  implementation).

- (only CLM5.0) 3: Update and average of soil moisture content for use
  with Cosmic-Ray data (Strebel implementation of Schr√∂n2017,
  <https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/improving-calibration-and-validation-of-cosmic-ray-neutron-sensor>).

#### CLM:update_texture
`CLM:update_texture`: (integer) Flag for update of soil parameter in
CLM (standalone only).

-  0: No update of soil parameter

-  1: Update of soil parameter (clay or sand)

-  (only CLM5.0) 2: Update of soil parameter (clay, sand or organic matter)

-  (only CLM5.0) 3: Update of hydraulic conductivity log-transformed

-  (only CLM5.0) 4: Update of hydraulic conductivity, porosity,
   suction, hydraulic conductivity exponent B (see CLM5.0 technical
   manual
   <https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/release-clm5.0/html/tech_note/index.html>)

#### CLM:print_swc
`CLM:print_swc`: (integer) If set to `1`, the updated soil moisture
content in CLM for all ensemble members is printed out as `netcdf`
files (one file per realisation for the whole simulation
period). Files are printed to the run directory and are named
according to the CLM problem prefix of the corresponding realisation
and include the specifier `update` in the file name.

#### CLM:print_et
`CLM:print_et`: (integer) Invoke function `write_clm_statistics`. For
further information, see source code.

### [COSMO]

#### COSMO:nprocs
`COSMO:nprocs`: (integer) Number of processors for each COSMO
instance.

Currently, `COSMO:nprocs` is NOT USED by TSMP-PDAF. Instead, COSMO
will get processors if there are processes left after giving
`PF:nprocs + CLM:nprocs` processes to ParFlow and CLM.

#### COSMO:dtmult
`COSMO:dtmult`: (integer) Number of COSMO time steps within one
ParFlow time step.

### [DA]

#### DA:outdir
`DA:outdir`: (string) Directory where assimilation results should be
written.

#### DA:nreal
`DA:nreal`: (integer) Number of realisations used in the
simulation. `DA:nreal` Must be equal to command line input
`n_modeltasks`.

#### DA:startreal
`DA:startreal`: (integer) Added to suffix-numbers for input file
creation.

#### DA:da_interval

`DA:da_interval`: (double) Time interval (units of ParFlow timing,
usually hours, check ParFlow input `TimingInfo.BaseUnit`,
<https://parflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keys.html#timing-information>).

After the time interval `da_interval` the forward simulation
(integration) of all component models is stopped in the main loop of
TSMP-PDAF (`pdaf_terrsysmp.f90`). Afterwards PDAF is called and it
depends on the command line option `delt_obs` ([Command line
options](./input_cmd.md#command-line-options)) whether data
assimilation is performed during this iteration. `delt_obs` will
specify the number of steps (loop iterations) that PDAF will iterate
back to the forward simulation, before performing the actual data
assimilation.

One exception is that the observation file is empty at a data
assimilation step. Then, no data assimilation takes place and the next
set forward integration steps is executed.

Formula for the simulation time between data assimilation steps (given
non-empty observation files)

\begin{gather*} 
	t_{\mathtt{betweenDA}} =  \mathtt{da\_interval} \cdot \mathtt{delt\_obs} \cdot \mathtt{BaseUnit}
\end{gather*}


**Example 1 (FallSchoolCase):** `da_interval=1.0`, `delt_obs 12`,
`TimingInfo.BaseUnit=1.0`. In this case, component models will be
simulated for 12 1-hour-steps between data assimilation times. So an
assimilation will be applied each 12 hours.

**Example 2:** `da_interval=24.0`, `delt_obs 1`,
`TimingInfo.BaseUnit=1.0`. In this case, component models will be
simulated for 1 24-hour-step between data assimilation times. So an
assimilation will be applied each 24 hours.

#### DA:stat_dumpoffset
`DA:stat_dumpoffset`: File number offset for the data assimilation
output files for ParFlow.  Can be used when an assimilation run is
restarted.

#### DA:screen_wrapper
`DA:screen_wrapper` (added 02/2022): Variable for controlling
output. Analogous to `screen` variable for PDAF. Values: (0) no
outputs, (1) medium outputs (default), (2) debugging output.

#### DA:point_obs
`DA:point_obs`: (integer) Only used in case of multiscalar data
assimilation. Set to value 0 for using multiscalar data assimilation
(eg. using SMAP satellite data over a large area which is not point
data). If not specified its default value is set to 1, which is for
using point observation for data assimilation run.

#### DA:obs_interp_switch
`DA:obs_interp_switch`: (integer) Switch for using an interpolation of
simulated measurements from the closest grid cells to the observation
location.

Default: `0` (no interpolation)

Effect:
- For [CLM-type
  observations](./input_obs.md#clm-observation-file-variables) the
  longitude and latitude inputs in the observation file are compared
  to the four neihboring grid points and the simulated measurements
  from these grid points are averaged with the distances to the grid
  points as weights.
- For [ParFlow-type
  observations](./input_obs.md#parflow-observation-file-variables): To
  be implemented.
