# Observation input #

Observation input consists of a number of different inputs:
- Observation files with correct name and content
- Command Line Options
- Preprocessor Variables

## Observation files ##

Observation files for TSMP-PDAF are netCDF files which follow a
certain naming convention. Each observation file has a fixed prefix
followed by the formatted number of the assimilation cycle which is
determined by [`da_interval`](./input_enkfpf.md#dada_interval)
. Additionally, the [command line
input](./input_cmd.md#command-line-options) `delt_obs` determines the
number of assimilation cycles/iterations/steps that are run purely
forward before checking an observation file again.

The prefix is chosen with the [command line
option](./input_cmd.md#command-line-options) `obs_filename`.

Example: If the chosen prefix is `myobs`, the observation files are
named `myobs.00001, myobs.00002, myobs.00003`, etc.

### General observation file variables ###

All observation files contain the following variable:

#### dim_obs ####

`dim_obs`: (int) The observation files contain one dimension named
`dim_obs` which should be set equal to the number of observations for
the respective assimilation cycle. The observation files for ParFlow
should contain the following variables which all should have the
dimension `dim_obs` (except variable `dr` in CLM observations files):

#### dampfac_state ####

`dampfac_state`: (real) Input of a time dependent state damping
factor. The damping factor for an update is given in the corresponding
observation file. This damping factor applies only to updates of
dynamic states in the DA-state vector and, when existing, replaces the
general input from
[PF:dampingfactor_state](./input_enkfpf.md#pfdampingfactor_state).

#### dampfac_param ####

`dampfac_param`: (real) Input of a time dependent state damping
factor. The state vector for an update is given in the corresponding
observation file. This damping factor applies only to parameter
updates in the DA state vector and, when existing, replaces the
general input from
[PF:dampingfactor_param](./input_enkfpf.md#pfdampingfactor_param).

### ParFlow observation file variables ###

If TSMP-PDAF is only applied with ParFlow, the following variables
have to be specified in the observation files:

#### obs_pf ####

`obs_pf`: (real) Observations for ParFlow (either pressure or soil
moisture)

#### obserr_pf ####

`obserr_pf`: (real) Observation errors which can be different for
individual observations (optional). If this variable is not
present. the command line option `rms_obs` (see [Command line
options](./input_cmd.md#command-line-options)) will be used to define
the observation error (equal for all observations).

#### ix ####

`ix`: (integer) Position of the observation in the ParFlow grid in
x-direction.

#### iy ####

`iy`: (integer) Position of the observation in the ParFlow grid in
y-direction.

#### iz ####

`iz`: (integer) Position of the observation in the ParFlow grid in
z-direction.

#### idx ####

`idx`: (integer) Index of the observation in the ParFlow grid.

The positions are always relative to the south-east corner cell at the
lowest model layer. The index `idx` can be calculated as follows:

\begin{gather*}
	idx = (iz-1) \cdot nx \cdot ny + (iy-1) \cdot nx + ix
\end{gather*}

where `nx` and `ny` are the number of grid cells in x- and y-direction
respectively and `ix`, `iy` and `iz` are the positions of the
observation in x-, y- and z-direction.

#### gw_indicator ####

`gw_indicator`: (integer) Indicates if the observation is a pressure
observation. Values: `0`, `1`.

- `0`: Soil water content observation (i.e. no pressure)
- `1`: Pressure observation

Used only for `gwmasking=2` (mixed state vector). When pressure
observations are present, the state vector variable at the observation
location and below is set to pressure (it may have been set to soil
water content before).

#### ix_interp_d ####

`ix_interp_d`: (real) Offset of the correct observation locations
compared to the position of the observation in the ParFlow grid
assigned with `ix`. Only used when
[`DA:obs_interp_switch`](./input_enkfpf.md#daobs_interp_switch) is set
to `1`.

The correct observation location should be located at

\begin{gather*} x_{obs} =
x_{grid}(ix) + \mathtt{ix\_interp\_d} \cdot \Delta x
\end{gather*}

where 
- Important: `0 <= ix_interp_d < 1`.
- $x_{obs}$: x-coordinate of the observation location
- $x_{grid}(ix)$: x-coordinate of grid cell with index `ix` in the
ParFlow grid. Note that $x_{grid}(ix) = \max_{ix}\{x(ix) | x(ix) <
x_{obs}\}$ (closest grid point that is smaller than $x_{obs}$)
- $\Delta x$: Difference of x-coordinate between grid cells
  neighboring observation location: $\Delta x = x_{grid}(ix+1) -
  x_{grid}(ix)$

##### Example #####

This example shows how to set `ix_interp_d` from a given (1) grid and
(2) observation location.

Let the observation location be at longitude $x_{obs} = 6.404$.

Let the grid be simple going from `6.3` to `6.5` in steps of `0.02`.
Example grid locations:
-  $x_{grid}(1) = 6.3$
-  $x_{grid}(6) = 6.4$
-  $x_{grid}(11) = 6.5$

We find `ix` and `ix_interp_d` as follows:

1. Find the two grid locations with longitudes closest to the
   observation location: $x_{grid}(6) = 6.4$, $x_{grid}(7) = 6.42$
2. Choose the index of the grid location smaller than $x_{obs}$ for
   observation file input `ix`: `ix=6`
3. Compute `ix_interp_d` from the two closest grid locations as follows

\begin{gather*}
\mathtt{ix\_interp\_d} = \frac{ x_{obs} -  x_{grid}(ix)}{ \Delta x}
\end{gather*}

Here this leads to `ix_interp_d=0.2`.

We can check this by computing $x_{obs}$ from `ix`, `ix_interp_d`:

\begin{align*}
x_{obs} &= x_{grid}(6) + \mathtt{ix\_interp\_d} \cdot \Delta x \\
   &= 6.4 + 0.2 \cdot 0.02 = 6.4 + 0.004 = 6.404
\end{align*}

#### iy_interp_d ####

`iy_interp_d`: (real) Offset of the correct observation locations
compared to the position of the observation in the ParFlow grid
assigned with `iy`. Only used when
[`DA:obs_interp_switch`](./input_enkfpf.md#daobs_interp_switch) is set
to `1`.

The correct observation location should be located at

\begin{gather*} y_{obs} =
y_{grid}(iy) + \mathtt{iy\_interp\_d} \cdot \Delta y
\end{gather*}

where 
- Important: `0 <= iy_interp_d < 1`.
- $y_{obs}$: y-coordinate of the observation location
- $y_{grid}(iy)$: y-coordinate of grid cell with index `iy` in the
ParFlow grid. Note that $y_{grid}(iy) = \max_{iy}\{y(iy) | y(iy) <
y_{obs}\}$ (closest grid point that is smaller than $y_{obs}$)
- $\Delta y$: Difference of y-coordinate grid cells neighboring
  observation location: $\Delta y = y_{grid}(iy+1) - y_{grid}(iy)$

##### Example #####

This example shows how to set `iy_interp_d` from a given (1) grid and
(2) observation location.

Let the observation location be at longitude $y_{obs} = 50.910$.

Let the grid be simple going from `50.8` to `51.0` in steps of `0.02`.
Example grid locations:
-  $y_{grid}(1) = 50.8$
-  $y_{grid}(6) = 50.9$
-  $y_{grid}(11) = 51.0$

We find `iy` and `iy_interp_d` as follows:

1. Find the two grid locations with longitudes closest to the
   observation location: $y_{grid}(6) = 50.9$, $y_{grid}(7) = 50.92$
2. Choose the index of the grid location smaller than $y_{obs}$ for
   observation file input `iy`: `iy=6`
3. Compute `iy_interp_d` from the two closest grid locations as follows

\begin{gather*}
\mathtt{iy\_interp\_d} = \frac{ y_{obs} -  y_{grid}(iy)}{ \Delta y }
\end{gather*}

Here this leads to `iy_interp_d=0.5`.

We can check this by computing $y_{obs}$ from `iy`, `iy_interp_d`:

\begin{align*}
y_{obs} &= y_{grid}(6) + \mathtt{iy\_interp\_d} \cdot \Delta y \\
   &= 50.9 + 0.5 \cdot 0.02 = 50.9 + 0.01 = 50.910
\end{align*}

### CLM observation file variables ###

If TSMP-PDAF is only applied with CLM, different variables have to be
specified in the observation files:

#### obs_clm ####

`obs_clm`: (real) Observations for CLM (soil moisture)

#### obserr_clm ####

`obserr_clm`: (real) Observation errors which can be different for
individual observations (optional). If this variable is not
present. the command line option `rms_obs` (see [Command line
options](./input_cmd.md#command-line-options)) will be used to define
the observation error (equal for all observations).

##### lon #####

`lon`: (real) Longitude of the observation.

#### lat ####

`lat`: (real) Latitude of the observation.

#### layer ####

`layer`: (integer) Index of CLM depth layer where the observation is
located.

`layer` counts downwards from uppermost CLM layer.

**Attention**: The uppermost CLM layer has index `layer=1`.

#### dr ####

`dr`: (real) Snapping distance for the observation.

**Attention** This variable should have a length of `2` (one snapping
distance in longitude direction and another snapping distance in
latitude direction).

Each of the CLM observations is snapped to the nearest CLM grid cell
based on the given `lon`, `lat` and the snapping distance `dr` which
should be smaller than the minimum grid cell size.

### Multi-Scale Data Assimilation observation file variables ###

The multi-scale data assimilation has been implemented for Local
Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter(LETKF) filter (`filtertype=5`).

Definition: Multiscale DA means that the simulation grid and
measurement grid are at different scales. 

Example for multi-scale data assimilation: Using SMAP satellite soil
moisture data at 9km resolution and a simulation grid at 1km
resolution. In this case the measurement gives than an average soil
moisture for the upper 5cm of the soil for 9 x 9 grid cells = 81 grid
cells. We do not have measurements for all individual grid cells, but
just an average value over those 81 grid cells (and the upper 5cm).

To turn on multi-scale data assimilation, we need to specify in
`enkfpf.par` the entry [`DA:point_obs`](./input_enkfpf.md#dapoint_obs)
to value `0` (integer).

Then in the observation files we need to specify variable
[`var_id`](#var_id) and the dimension `dim_nx` and `dim_ny`.

![Grids](./figures/multi_scale_da.png)

#### var_id ####

`var_id`: (integer) ID of cells with similar observations.

Only used for [multi-scale data
assimilation](#multi-scale-data-assimilation-observation-file-variables)
(turned on using [`DA:point_obs`](./input_enkfpf.md#dapoint_obs)).

The size of `var_id` is `dim_obs`.

`var_id` has equal values over model grid cells, which have range of
similar observations values from raw data over them.

The values of `var_id` can be grouped starting from 1 for similar
observation values to other integers (2,3,4,5 etc.) for other similar
observations.

If there are no observations over some grid cells than a
negative `var_id` (integer) is assigned to them.

#### dim_nx ####

`dim_nx`: (int) This is the x-dimension of the remote sensing
measurment in multi-scale Data Assimilation.

#### dim_ny ####

`dim_ny`: (int) This is the y-dimension of the remote sensing
measurment in multi-scale Data Assimilation.

## Observation time flexibility ##

Currently, in TSMP-PDAF there are a number input options that
determine, when observations are read-in and assimilated:

- [da_interval](./input_enkfpf.md#dada_interval)
- [`delt_obs`](./input_cmd.md#delt_obs)
- Parflow: `TimeInfo.BaseUnit`
- Observation file NetCDF variable `no_obs`

The goal of this section is to show how these inputs can be used to
create a flexible observation time input.

First, `da_interval` and `TimeInfo.BaseUnit` define the forward
integration step that is executed during on iteration of the main
TSMP-PDAF loop. This is the smallest time interval in your model and
it determines the counter, also for observation file names. So
`da_interval` should be small enough that each possible observation
can be attributed to one timestep.

Next, `delt_obs` is used to specify if data assimilation is not to be
called at every iteration/cycle of `da_interval`. If two available
observations are only `da_interval` apart, `delt_obs` has to be set to
`1`. However, suppose observations daily at noon, and `da_interval` is
one hour, then `delt_obs` could be chosen as `24`.

Now, PDAF will be called every `delt_obs` iterations/cycles. However,
there is one last way of manipulating observation input, by setting
the NetCDF variable `no_obs` in the observation file to `0`. In this
case, PDAF will skip the assimilation during that observation files
cycle. So, in principle, one could set `delt_obs` to `1`, thus needing
an observation file at every cycle. At each timestep that is not
supposed to be assimilated, one could supply an alsmost-empty
observation file with just a single variable `no_obs` that has the
value `0`. By this workaround, one obtains a fairly flexible
observation time input!

Example code for setting variable `no_obs` to zero in an existing NetCDF
file:
```python
import scipy.io as scio

f = scio.netcdf_file("swc_obs.00001","a", mmap=False) # append
f.variables["no_obs"].assignValue(0)
f.close()
```

Example code for generating a minimal NetCDF observation file with
just one variable `no_obs` set to zero:
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.io as scio

f = scio.netcdf_file("swc_obs.00001","w", mmap=False) # write
f.createDimension("dim_noobs", 1)
f.createVariable("no_obs", np.int32, ["dim_noobs"])
f.variables["no_obs"].assignValue(0)
f.close()
```

## Specifying type of observation at compile time ##

The following preprocessor variables let the user specify the expected
observational input (i.e. ParFlow or CLM observations) at compile time
(during the build-process). This may save some time during execution
as certain parts of the source code are not accessed at all.

CLM observations: Set
- [CLMSA](./../build_tsmp/build_preprocessor_variables.md#clmsa)
- [OBS_ONLY_CLM](./../build_tsmp/build_preprocessor_variables.md#obs_only_clm)

ParFlow observations: Set
- [PARFLOW_STAND_ALONE](./../build_tsmp/build_preprocessor_variables.md#parflow_stand_alone)
- [OBS_ONLY_PARFLOW](./../build_tsmp/build_preprocessor_variables.md#obs_only_parflow)
